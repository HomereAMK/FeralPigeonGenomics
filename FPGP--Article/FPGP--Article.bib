  abstract = "Through its long history of artificial selection, the rock pigeon
              (Columba livia Gmelin, 1789) was forged into a large number of
              domestic breeds. The incredible amount of phenotypic diversity
              exhibited in these breeds has long held the fascination of
              scholars, particularly those interested in biological inheritance
              and evolution. However, exploiting them as a model system is
              challenging, as unlike with many other domestic species, few
              reliable records exist about the origins of, and relationships
              between, each of the breeds. Therefore, in order to broaden our
              understanding of the complex evolutionary relationships among
              pigeon breeds, we generated genome-wide data by performing the
              Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) method on close to 200 domestic
              individuals representing over 60 breeds. We analyzed this GBS
              data alongside previously published Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)
              data, and this combined analysis allowed us to conduct the most
              extensive phylogenetic analysis of the group, including two feral
              pigeons and one outgroup. We improve previous phylogenies, find
              considerable population structure across the different breeds,
              and identify unreported interbreed admixture events. Despite the
              reduced number of loci relative to WGS, we demonstrate that GBS
              data provide sufficient analytical power to investigate
              intertwined evolutionary relationships, such as those that are
              characteristic of animal domestic breeds. Thus, we argue that
              future studies should consider sequencing methods akin to the GBS
              approach as an optimal cost-effective approach for addressing
              complex phylogenies.",
